## First steps

* Install all dependecies running `yarn`
* Throw `gulp` or `gulp default`, then open `http://localhost:3000` to start working.


## Dependency management with [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

Add a new package with `yarn add package -D`

Update them with `yarn update [package | package@version | package@tag]`, `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest` or `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest`.



## Test Suite with [JEST](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

Simply run `npm test` to run unit tests or `npm run coverage` if you want coverage to be shown.

We use `datasets` thanks to [jest-each](https://github.com/mattphillips/jest-each).



## Linters

JS with [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), edit `.eslintrc` file to add/modify rules.

CSS with [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint), edit `.stylelintrc` file to add/modify rules.



## Next steps
* Add nunjucks, PUG or jade
* Option to work svg as sprite or as partials
* Production / Staging environment
